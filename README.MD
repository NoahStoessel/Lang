## This language has no name for now but it will soon

No name is a multi paradigm high speed compiled programming language that is inspired by typescript, python, rust, go and fortran

No name has a smart plugin system for managing packages and code so your program only imports what it needs and extra bloat from the stdlib doesnt slow it down
